Overview

The CNC Plotter / Laser Cutter is a multi-axis computer-controlled machine designed for precise plotting, engraving, and laser cutting operations.
This project focuses on innovation, affordability, and flexibility, making advanced CNC technology accessible for education, prototyping, and small-scale manufacturing.

Problem Statement

Commercial multi-axis CNC machines and laser cutters are:
Very expensive
Complex to maintain
Not easily accessible for students, makers, and small workshops
This project aims to bridge the gap by developing a low-cost, customizable CNC Plotter / Laser Cutter with multi-axis capability.

Innovation & Uniqueness

🔹 5-Axis motion control (X, Y, Z + A, B)
🔹 Dual functionality: Plotting + Laser Cutting
🔹 Modular design (tool head can be changed)
🔹 Low-cost components compared to industrial CNC
🔹 Suitable for education, R&D, and startups

⚙️ Working Principle

A design file (G-code) is generated using CNC software.
The controller interprets G-code commands.
Stepper motors drive motion along X, Y, Z, A, and B axes.
The tool head (pen or laser module) performs:
Drawing / plotting
Engraving
Cutting (laser mode)
Precision motion is achieved using calibrated motor control and rigid mechanical structure
